            <p>Jirisan is a mountain located in the southern region of South Korea. It is the second-tallest mountain in South Korea after Jeju Island's Hallasan, and the tallest mountain in mainland South Korea.
               The 1915m-high mountain is located in Jirisan National Park. The park spans three provinces (North, South Jeolla and South Gyeongsang) and is the largest in South Korea. 
                The largest proportion of the national park is in the province of South Gyeongsang. The highest peak of the mountain, Cheonwangbong is also located in this province. 
                Another well-known peak is Samshin-bong (Three Spirits Peak).
                Jirisan is at the southern end of the Sobaek and Baekdudaegan mountain ranges, the "spine" of the Korean Peninsula incorporating the Sobaek mountain range and most of the Taebaek mountain range. </p>

            <p>Boseong green tea plantation is in a beautiful natural atmosphere consisting of tea fields in an area of around 1.5 million pyeong. 
               Daehan Tea Company in Boseong, Joellanam-do, is the only tea theme park in Korea. The farm is located in the oldest tea field in Korea.
               Boseong has long been known as the site of Korean tea. Geographically, its location at the far end of the Korean peninsula means that the fields are close to the sea in an ideal condition for cultivating tea with warm climate and proper temperature and humidity. 
               Daehan Tea Company started growing tea since 1957. It is literally the oldest tea plantation in Korea. Except for Jeju Island, this is the largest tea plantation in Korea and the quality boasts the best in Korea.
               The plantation, located at the foot of a mountain overlooking Bongsan-ri of Boseong-eup, is located in a vast flatland of around 30,000 pyeong. At the entrance to the plantation are electric pole sized armful Japan cedar trees that give out freshness. </p>

            <p>Metasequoia Garosu-gil Road was built by the 19th Damyang-gun Mayor Kim Gi-Hoe in 1972. 
               This road planted 1,300 5-year old trees in a 5km stretch from National Road 24 to County Office-Geumseong-myeon Wonyul three-way intersection. 
               Garnering budget from the cash-strapped county and tending planted trees, it became the Damyangâ€™s beautiful Metasequoia Garosu-gil Road. </p>
