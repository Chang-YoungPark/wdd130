      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to share information about good places such as mountains, lakes, rivers, beaches, and historical areas in Korea <br>
         I introduce Korea.<br>
         I travel a lot of places in Korea with my family<br>
         I take pictures of places that my family has visited and research those places<br>
         My company shares the information about a lot of places in Korea with the foreigners. <br>  
         My company makes websites for the foreigners who have the plan to visit Korea. <br>
         the results make the time of the foreigners reduce to find and make planning <br>
         Finally, you can see the blog of the foreigner about Korea on the website we made.<br>
         We make a website for sharing information about Korea with the more foreigners.<br>
         I do this work for sharing information about Korea<br>
